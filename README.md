# Project Overview

Wisabi Bank wants to analyze its ATM transactions to improve service efficiency, customer experience, and ATM utilization. This project provides insights into transaction trends, customer behavior, and ATM performance across different locations.

# Business Problems

The project aims to answer the following key business questions:

1. What is the average transaction amount by location and transaction type?

2. Which ATM location has the highest number of transactions per day, and at what time of the day do the transactions occur most frequently?

3. Which age group has the highest number of transactions, and which transaction type do they usually perform?

4. What is the trend of transaction volume and transaction amount over time, and are there any seasonal trends or patterns?

5. What is the most common transaction type, and how does it vary by location and customer type (Wisabi customer vs. non-Wisabi customer)?

6. What is the average transaction amount and transaction frequency per customer by occupation and age group?

7. What is the percentage of transactions that are withdrawals, savings, balance inquiries, and transfers, and how does it vary by location and time of day?

8. What is the distribution of transaction amounts and transaction frequency, and are there any outliers?

9. Which ATM locations have the highest and lowest utilization rates, and what factors contribute to this utilization rate?

10. What is the average transaction time by location, transaction type, and time of day, and how does it vary by customer type and occupation?
